Unity project which simulate basic genetic algorithms
It simulates process of natural selection. Fittest individuals from a population will survive longer and they produce offspring which inherit the characteristics of the parents and will be added to the next generation.

Is designed to consider five important phases in genetic algorithm
1. Initial population
2. Fitness function
3. Selection
4. Crossover
5. Mutation
